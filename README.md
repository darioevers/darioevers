I have a demonstrated history of working in the financial & consumer electronics industry and am a certified office operations professional.

Previously, I worked as VP Operations for
Finrocks and associated companies, as well

My path of education shall not end yet and Im
eager to learn all I can about not only frond-
& back-end development, but also all other
interesting technologies.
